# Virtus Tech School Syllabus

This syllabus contains the most important details(we tried to [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), like we do with our software ðŸ˜œ) of the full-stack software development course that Virtus Tech School offers.

## Meeting Times

**Virtus campus:**
- 2 sessions / week
- 8 hours / Saturday
- 5 hours / Sunday

**Slack:**
- 24/7, cuz we don't sleep ðŸ˜œ

> **Note:** The course will include assignments after every meeting at Virtus campus, so you are expected to put in a lot of work during the week as well.

> **Note:** Virtus campus is open every day of the week.

## Description

Virtus Tech School provides a fast-paced introductory course to full stack software development. It is intended for those with none to little programming background, though prior programming experience will make it easier, and those with previous experience will still learn a lot of software development concepts and best practices.

The course introduces fundamental principles and techniques of software development like:

- OOP: Object-oriented programming
- Functional programming
- TDD: Test-driven development
- SOLID principles: understandable, flexible, and maintainable software.

Additionally, this course introduces software development concepts like:

- Client-server & Layered architecture
- RESTful API
- Relational database
- Cloud computing


## Objectives

By the end of the course, you should be able to:

- Understand and use the programming constructs of JAVA & Javascript.
- Understand and use HTML and CSS frameworks.
- Understand and use the constructs of MySQL.
- Understand and use constructs of frameworks like Spring Boot and React.
- Deploy applications using Google Cloud Platform.
- Understand and use agile principles and collaboration tools.

## Mechanics

Except for the name, this course has nothing to do with a traditional course. Our main goal is to prepare job-ready Software Engineers, and we intend to do this by applying some key concepts:

- No formal lectures, no formal instructors.
- You are not coming to your school, you are coming to your full-time job.
- Project-based learning.
- Focus on the why, not only the how.
- Learn by doing, not by theory and rarely practicing it.

As we stated above, the Virtus campus is not your school campus, its your company campus. You will be coming everyday to work in the "company-like environment" that we will create.

Your instructor is not going to be your lecturer or teacher, he is going to be your Tech Lead. He will not hold any lectures, he will be there to organize the work, distribute the tasks and mentor you.

You are not expected to be a student, you will be working on a Software Engineering Internship job. You are responsible for delivering solution to your tasks and collaborate with your teammates.
